# ESM-Stream: Protein Structure Prediction Streamlit App

## Introduction
ESM-Stream is a Streamlit app designed for Protein Structure Prediction using Deep Learning with ESMFold. ESMFold is a powerful protein structure predictor based on the ESM-2 language model. For detailed technical insights, you can refer to the [research article](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.07.20.500902v2) and the informative [news article](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-03539-1) published in *Nature*.

## Usage
To run the ESM-Stream app, follow these steps:


1. **Clone the Repository**:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jaywyawhare/ESM-Stream.git

cd ESM-Stream
```

2. Set Up Your Environment:

Ensure you have the required dependencies and environment set up as mentioned in the project's documentation.

3. Running the Streamlit App:

Run the Streamlit app with the following command:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

4. Using the App:

Once the app is running, open it in your web browser. You can then interact with the app to predict protein structures based on input sequences.

## Example

Here's an example of using the ESMFold Streamlit app:

1. Run the Streamlit app as described in the usage section.
1. Open the app in your web browser.
1. Input your protein sequence.
1. Click the "Predict" button to generate the protein structure prediction.
